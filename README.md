# Supplementary material for paper [Estimation of clinical utility in estimated clinical trials](add.link)

This repository is a supplement to our paper and contains all the R code for simulations and contains the estimators used in the real data example.
In variance_estimation are two version of the clinical utility used to estimate the clinical utility and its asymptotic variances. The estimators in the script variance_estimate.R estimate the clinical utility of two DTRs where as the script variance_estimate_SOC uses only one DTR compares it to the standard of care (SOC). 

## Description

The R scripts in this repository are used to perform simulations and implement the estimators described in the paper.

## Prerequisites

- R version 4.0 or higher
- Required R packages:
  - ggplot2
  - nnet
  - xtable
